# NanoX
A Transformer GAN with Reinforcement Learning on generating novel ready to mass manufacture nanomachines

# Detailed Plan for AI-driven Synthesis of Nanomachines

The ultimate goal of this project is to generate a detailed blueprint of easy-to-manufacture, non-invasive, high-performance nanomachines. This isn't about creating chemical formulas but designing efficient nanostructures that have effective functionality within the human body for a variety of tasks. We'll aim for a nanomachine design that can be easily replicated and mass-produced.

## Model Architecture
The proposed architecture is a hybrid model, combining the concepts of Deep Learning (specifically Transformer architecture) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).



### Transformer-GAN (TransGAN)
In this architecture, the GAN comprises two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is responsible for producing new nanomachine designs while the discriminator's job is to evaluate these designs for viability. Both the generator and the discriminator are powered by Transformer models.

- **Why TransGAN?** The combination of Transformer and GAN is highly effective for generative tasks. The transformer model, with its self-attention mechanism, can understand and learn complex patterns and dependencies in data. The GAN setup encourages the generation of high-quality and realistic designs, as the generator continually learns to create better designs to "fool" the discriminator.

Given the complexity of nanomachines and the multiple factors they interact with, the inputs to the model would be multidimensional and highly varied. We would need to collect a vast amount of data related to nanomachine design, material properties, their interaction with biological systems, and more. 

## Inputs:

1. **Nanomachine Design Parameters**: These can include size, shape, material properties, and other physical properties of the nanomachines.

2. **Material Properties**: Data about various properties of different materials such as tensile strength, flexibility, durability, reaction with human body, etc.

3. **Biological Impact**: Information about how nanomachines interact with various biological systems. This can include data about their impact on cells, tissues, and different bodily systems.

4. **Performance Data**: Data related to the performance of existing nanomachines for tasks such as healing cellular damage, cosmic ray effect detoxification, athletic performance enhancement, etc.

5. **Random Noise Vector (z)**: In the context of GANs, the input to the generator is a random noise vector (latent space), which the generator uses to create new instances.

The Transformer-GAN (TransGAN) would take these inputs and, through the process of training, learn to generate feasible blueprints of nanomachines. The generator would create new designs (inspired by the random noise vector `z`) and the discriminator would assess these designs based on the other input data, providing feedback to the generator.

The final output would be a design that the discriminator can't distinguish from a "real" or "feasible" design, indicating that the generator has learned to create valid nanomachine blueprints. These generated designs are ready-to-manufacture blueprints, detailing all the necessary parameters such as structure, size, material, and functional aspects of the nanomachines.

## Definitive Task
The definitive task we are trying to model is the generation of a blueprint or schema for nanomachines that can be easily mass-produced and are non-invasive yet high-performing. This blueprint should detail the structure, size, material, and functional aspects of the nanomachines.

The task of generating nanomachine blueprints is an instance of a generative modeling problem. The goal is to learn the underlying data distribution of nanomachine designs and then draw samples (i.e., generate new designs) from that distribution. 

A common mathematical formulation for such problems involves the use of probability and optimization theory.

Suppose we have a dataset `D = {x1, x2, ..., xn}` of `n` nanomachine designs. We assume these designs are drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some unknown distribution `p_data(x)`.

Our goal is to train a model with parameters `θ` to generate new nanomachine designs. This model defines a probability distribution `p_model(x; θ)`. We want to make `p_model(x; θ)` close to `p_data(x)`.

To measure the "closeness" of these two distributions, we can use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:

`KL(p_data || p_model) = ∑x p_data(x) log (p_data(x) / p_model(x; θ))`

Since `p_data` is the true but unknown data distribution, this formula is not directly computable. Instead, we minimize the negative log-likelihood of the data, which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence:

`L(θ; D) = -1/n ∑ log p_model(xi; θ) for all xi in D`

This is the optimization problem we need to solve:

`θ* = arg min L(θ; D) over all θ`

In the context of our Transformer-GAN (TransGAN) model, we have two sets of parameters: `θ_G` for the generator and `θ_D` for the discriminator. The generator wants to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to distinguish real designs from the fake ones. This results in a min-max game:

`min θ_G max θ_D V(θ_D, θ_G)`

where `V` is a value function defined by:

`V(θ_D, θ_G) = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(z)))]`

Here, `E` denotes the expectation, `D(x)` is the discriminator's estimate of the probability that real nanomachine design `x` is real, and `G(z)` is the nanomachine design generated by the generator from a random noise `z`.

Generative models, and specifically GANs, have shown strong performance in generating new instances of complex data like images. Since nanomachine designs are also complex data, it's reasonable to use a GAN. Further, the use of a Transformer within the GAN is motivated by the need to understand and capture dependencies in the design data.


## Datasets
To train this model, we need extensive and diverse data. Here are some readily available datasets that can be beneficial:

1. **Material Sciences Datasets**: Datasets like the Materials Project, OQMD (Open Quantum Materials Database), AFLOWLIB.org etc. can provide insight into various materials and their properties. This data can inform the AI about feasible and efficient materials for nanomachine construction.

2. **Nanodevice Datasets**: Existing databases from research in the field of nanodevices and nanotechnology can provide a good starting point for our AI model.

3. **Biomedical Datasets**: Datasets like The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), Human Protein Atlas, GenBank (NIH genetic sequence database), etc. can provide useful information about human physiology and how nanomachines can interact with it.

4. **Physics Datasets**: Datasets such as PhysioNet (containing a wealth of biomedical research data) and CERN's Open Data Portal could provide crucial insights into the laws that govern the behaviors of nanomachines.

This approach ensures that we not only create efficient designs but also consider the complexities of the real world, such as the laws of physics and material limitations. The final goal is to have an AI system that can generate practical, viable, and manufacturable designs of nanomachines.
